## Build a Basic ML Model for Text Classification

 - In this notebook, you'll learn how to implement a text classification task using machine learning. 
 - You'll learn to create basic NLP based features that can be created from the text and you'll then test the model on the test data set to evaluate it's performance.
 
To make things interesting, the task is to build a machine learning model to **classify** whether a particular tweet is **hate speech** or **not**. I'll explain more as you proceed further, so let's start without much ado!
